b) captains["Enterprise"] = "Picard"
captains["Voyager"] = "Janeway"
captains["Defiant"] = "Sisko"
c) d",
"Voyager": "Janeway",
"Defiant": "Sisko",
}
d) None of the above
Ans. b) &c)
19 ) You’re really building out the Federation Starfleet now! Here’s what you have:
captains = {
"Enterprise": "Picard",
"Voyager": "Janeway",
"Defiant": "Sisko",
"Discovery": "unknown",
}Now, say you want to display the ship and captain names contained in the dictionary, but you also
want to provide some additional context. How could you do it?
a) for item in captains.items():
print(f"The [ship] is captained by [captain].")

print(f"The {ship} is captained by {captain}.")
c) for captain, ship in captains.items():
print(f"The {ship} is captained by {captain}.")
d) All are correct

20 )
You’ve created a dictionary, added data, checked for the existence of keys, and iterated over it with

"Defiant": "Sisko",
"Discovery": "unknown",
}
What statement will remove the entry for the key "Discovery"?
